If on a mac, do the following:
Install python and pip (Follow the source installations after googling)
pip install pygame
cd into the folder 
run:
python game.py
You should be able to play the game

If on windows, there is an executable package built, use that to run the game 

If on ubuntu, there is an executable in the build folder
